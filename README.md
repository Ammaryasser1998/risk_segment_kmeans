# Credit Risk Profile Segmentation
Segmenting Credit Risk profiles with KMeans on a credit dataset from the federal bureau

This repository contains a credit risk modeling project where we use machine learning techniques to predict loan defaults and segment borrowers into risk levels using K-Means clustering.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on loans using various machine learning models and segment them into high, medium, or low-risk categories based on their default probability. The financial impact is assessed through metrics like Expected Loss and Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC).

## **Features**
- Loan amount data used as Exposure at Default (EAD).
- Classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Clustering borrowers into risk segments using K-Means.
- Calculation of Expected Loss (EL) and Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC).
